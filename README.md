# About the Project

This is a weather application built using React.js that allows users to search for any city and view real-time weather information using the OpenWeatherMap API.
I created this project to understand how frontend applications interact with third-party APIs and how to handle real-world scenarios such as invalid inputs and error responses. Before this project, I had only worked on static or simple applications. This project helped me understand how dynamic data is fetched, processed, and displayed in the UI.
The app displays temperature, humidity, minimum and maximum temperature, and weather conditions. It also changes images and icons dynamically based on the weather.

# Technologies Used

***Frontend***

React.js – Used to build the user interface and manage state

Material UI (MUI) – Used for input fields, buttons, cards, and icons

JavaScript (ES6+) – Core logic and API handling

CSS – Custom styling

***API***

OpenWeatherMap API – Used to fetch real-time weather data

# Features

Search weather by city name

Real-time weather data fetched from an external API

***Displays:***

Current temperature

Minimum and maximum temperature

Humidity

“Feels like” temperature

Weather description

Dynamic images and icons based on weather conditions

Proper error handling for invalid city names

Clean and simple user interface

***How the App Works***

The user enters a city name in the search box.

The frontend sends a request to the OpenWeather API.

The API returns weather data in JSON format.

The app checks whether the response is valid.

If the city exists:

Weather details are extracted.

The UI updates automatically using React state.

If the city does not exist:

An error message is shown without crashing the app.

***Where This App Can Be Used***

Daily weather checking

Travel planning

Learning API integration

Understanding frontend state management

Beginner-level weather dashboards

***What I Learned From This Project***

How to integrate third-party APIs in React

How fetch works and how to handle API errors manually

How to manage state using React hooks

How to conditionally render UI elements

How to structure a React project properly

How to push projects to GitHub and manage versions

**Limitations**

No backend or database integration

API key is currently used on the frontend

No authentication system

Limited weather condition categories

**Future Improvements**

Move API key to environment variables

Add loading indicators while fetching data

Support more weather conditions (cloudy, mist, snow)

Improve mobile responsiveness

Convert API handling to Axios

Deploy the application online

**Final Note**

This project helped me gain confidence in building real-world React applications and understanding how APIs work in practice. It strengthened my fundamentals in React, error handling, and UI logic, and prepared me for more advanced full-stack projects.
